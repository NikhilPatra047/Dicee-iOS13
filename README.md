# Dicee

## Goal

The objective of creating this app is to introduce myself to the core programming concepts that will form the foundation of most of the apps that I’ll build in the future. This app taught me a lot of important programming knowledge, while building a neat dice app.

## What did I create

I made a Las Vegas dice app. I made the die roll at the press of a button. With this app in your pocket, you’ll be fully set up to settle any score on the go!


## What did I learn

* How to clone an existing Xcode project from GitHub.
* Create an app with behaviour and functionality.
* Create links between the Interface Builder files and code using IBActions and IBOutlets.
* Get familiar with the Xcode code editor.
* * Learn to use comments to annotate code.
* Understand and use Swift constants and variables.
* Understand and use collection types such as Swift arrays.
* Test and debug your app with the Xcode console.
* Learn about randomisation and how to generate random numbers in Swift.
